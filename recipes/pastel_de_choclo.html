  <h1>Pastel de choclo</h1>
  <img src="../images/pastel.jpg" width="600" height="auto">
  <p><em>Pastel de choclo </em>is an iconic dish—a classic during the summertime. The traditional Pastel de Choclo is usually cooked in a clay dish inside a wood-burning oven if living in the countryside. A standard oven and a baking pan are enough if residing in the city. The flavors of the meat and corn mingle delightfully in this casserole.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>For the corn mixture,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>500 grams of frozen corn or 10 cups</li>

  </ul>
  <p>For the meat,</p>
  <ul>
    <li>2 tablespoons of vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
    <li>1 cup water or beef broth</li>
    <li>3 onions, diced small</li>
    <li>merken or 1 tablespoon paprika</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cummin</li>

    <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <p>For the meat, </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Heat the oil in a large pot, saute the beef until lightly browned, about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, add the paprika, salt, pepper, and cumin, sauté 2 minutes more.
    </li>
    <li>Add the broth and simmer for 30 minutes over low heat.
    </li>
    <li>Add the onion, mix well, and cook over medium heat until the onion is tender, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.
    </li>
    <li>Turn off heat and add the flour and stir well. Adjust seasoning if necessary. Cool and refrigerate or use immediately.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>For the corn mixture, </p>
  <ol>
    <li>In a cast iron or a large pot with a thick bottom, melt the butter over medium-high heat, add the frozen corn, and occasionally stir for about 8 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>Add milk, basil, salt, pepper, and Merquén or paprika and continue to cook, occasionally stirring for about 10 minutes longer.
    </li>
    <li>With a hand blender, blend the corn, trying not to go uniform, leaving some chunky parts. Add the cornmeal and continue cooking over medium heat for 5 minutes. The consistency should be firm. Taste and adjust seasoning. It will thicken slightly when cool.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>To assemble the pie, </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Put one layer of the prepared meat filling on a clay or baking dish. Add cooked or rotisserie chicken parts, quartered hard-boiled eggs, olives, and raisins on top of the meat.
    </li>
    <li>Cover with the corn mixture. Sprinkle with granulated sugar for a nice browning in the oven.
    </li>
    <li>Bake at 400F or 200C in a preheated oven for 45-60 minutes until bubbling and golden on top. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.
