  <h1>Curanto</h1>
  <img src="../images/curanto.jpg" width="600" height="auto">
  <p><em>Chilean curanto </em>is an authentically Chilean dish originating on the Archipelago of Chiloé. Historically this meal was made by digging a hole about 1 ½ yards deep, putting in red hot stones that were heated in a bonfire and then adding in an assortment of seafood, meats and vegetables. This was then covered with nalca leaves basically Chilean rhubarb and then covered with wet sacks.</p>
